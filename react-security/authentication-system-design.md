### Authentication System Design

#### HTTP Stateful

### Authentication Request

An authentication request is a process where a user provides credentials (such as a username and password) to verify their identity. The system then checks these credentials against stored data to determine if the user is authorized to access the requested resources.

### Session Token

A session token is a unique identifier generated by the server to track a user's session. It is stored on the server and sent to the client to maintain the session state across multiple requests.

- The database contains a session token for the user.
- When the user logs in, the API generates a session ID and stores it in the database.

### Session Token Storage

- **Cookie Based (Easy)**

  - Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client-side and sent to the server with each request. They are easy to implement and widely supported by browsers. However, they can be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if not handled properly.

- **Local Storage (More Work)**
  - Local Storage is a web storage mechanism that allows you to store data on the client-side. It provides more storage capacity compared to cookies and is not sent with every HTTP request, which can improve performance. However, it requires more work to implement secure storage and handling, and it is also vulnerable to XSS attacks.

### Architectural Concern

#### Session Token

- Validating session tokens against the database can introduce latency and increase database load. Use caching and efficient queries to mitigate these issues.

**Advantages:**

- Simplifies the process of maintaining user sessions.
- Can be easily invalidated by removing the token from the server.
- Supports stateless authentication when using tokens like JWT.

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires secure storage and transmission to prevent token theft.
- Can introduce latency and database load if not managed properly.
- Vulnerable to XSS attacks if not handled securely.

**Usage:**

- Commonly used in web applications to maintain user sessions.
- Suitable for both stateful (session ID) and stateless (JWT) authentication mechanisms.
- Often used in APIs to authenticate and authorize requests.

### Authentication Header

- The authentication header ensures each request to the server includes credentials to verify the user's identity.
- Typically includes tokens like JWT (JSON Web Token) or other authentication tokens.
- Proper implementation maintains the security and integrity of the application.

### Session Tokens and Database Hits

- **DB Hit Requirement**: Validating session tokens requires a database hit, which can introduce latency.
- **DOS Attack**: High frequency of authentication requests can lead to Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.
- **DB Scale Concern**: Increased load on the database can affect scalability. Use caching to mitigate.

### JSON Web Token (JWT)

A JWT is a compact, URL-safe token used for securely transmitting information between parties. It is digitally signed to ensure integrity and authenticity.

#### Structure of JWT

1. **Header**: Metadata about the token, including type (JWT) and signing algorithm (e.g., HMAC SHA256).
2. **Payload**: Contains claims about the user and additional data. Claims can be predefined (e.g., `iss`, `exp`, `sub`) or custom.
3. **Signature**: Ensures the token's integrity by signing the encoded header and payload with a secret and the specified algorithm.

JWTs are stateless and efficient for authentication and information exchange in distributed systems.

### Key Security Measures for Creating a Website

1. **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

2. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) and ensure proper authorization checks to restrict access to sensitive resources.

4. **Secure Storage**: Store sensitive data, such as passwords and tokens, securely using strong encryption and hashing algorithms.

5. **Session Management**: Use secure methods for session management, such as setting secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite attributes on cookies, and implementing session timeouts.

6. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing detailed error messages to users, as they can reveal sensitive information about the server or application.

7. **Regular Updates**: Keep all software, libraries, and dependencies up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.

8. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks by controlling the sources from which content can be loaded.

9. **Security Headers**: Use security headers like X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection to enhance the security of your web application.

10. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to ensure that users can only access resources they are authorized to use.

11. **Monitoring and Logging**: Regularly monitor and log activities to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.

12. **Data Backup**: Regularly back up data to ensure it can be restored in case of data loss or a security breach.

13. **Security Testing**: Perform regular security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, to identify and fix security issues.

## https://local.example --auth admin:super-secret -v

## echo -n 'admin:super-secret" | base64

## echo -n 'ZmFrZXVzZXI6ZmFrZXBhc3N3b3Jk" | base64 -- decode

- admin:super-secret

## Must be done always in TLS or HTTPS

- TLS/HTTPS encrypts data to protect it from being intercepted.
